,"Users' Azure Active Directory accounts were previously being locked out for 15 minutes after four incorrect password attempts globally, impacting remote workers accessing Brampton's resources.","Previous Policy (Before March 17th, 2023):

Azure Active Directory now maintains a log of IP addresses from which users have successfully logged in.

If a malicious actor attempts four incorrect password entries from an unfamiliar location, Azure AD will lock the account for 15 minutes globally, except for the known IP addresses listed.
This change ensures that users working from home are not locked out if unauthorized access attempts originate from different global locations.

With iOS 17, Live Voicemail is turned on by default.
A user no longer needs to check their messages the old way
Use Live Voicemail on your iPhone
With Live Voicemail in iOS 17, you can view a real-time transcription of the message someone is leaving you as they speak, giving you immediate context for the call. If you want to address it, you can pick up the call while they're still on the line.

Turn Live Voicemail on or off
1. Open the Settings app, then tap Phone.
2. Tap Live Voicemail.
3. Turn Live Voicemail on or off.
In iOS 17 and later, Live Voicemail is on by default.

Live Voicemail is available only in English in the United States and Canada, excluding Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Send a call to Live Voicemail
When you receive an incoming call and you want to send it to Live Voicemail, tap the Voicemail button.
If you don't answer a call, it's also sent to Live Voicemail.
Where to find Live Voicemail transcriptions
After a call, you can find voicemails captured by your phone with Live Voicemail in the Voicemail tab of the Phone app.
Transcriptions captured during Live Voicemail are available to view as long as you keep the voicemail in your inbox. We know that voicemails can contain precious moments. Your voicemails are never deleted on your behalf, so you can keep them for as long as you'd like.
If Visual Voicemail is turned on, voicemails captured by your carrier also appear in the Voicemail tab. If your iPhone is turned off or out of your carrier network's range, calls go to carrier voicemail. Otherwise, the call goes to Live Voicemail.
Visual Voicemail is available from select carriers in select countries or regions.

,Xplor/PerfectMind � Workstation and PinPad Configuration Notes VLAN�s and Static IP�s,"PerfectMind is the recreation application which replaced CLASS at the COB recreation centers and service areas.   In order to meet with PCI compliance, a number of configurations need to take place with each machine.  This will need to be kept in mind when performing machine replacements, reimaging and refresh, as well as for troubleshooting purposes.
 
VLANs
 
Each workstation that uses PerfectMind AND has a pinpad attached, will need to be in a separate VLAN (VLAN 136).  This will give the machine a 172.30.136.x address
Each pinpad for PerfectMind will need to be in a separate VLAN as well (VLAN 862).  This will give the pinpad a 192.168.162.x.
 
In order to facilitate the above, the switch port that the pinpad and workstation are plugged into have been configured for the appropriate VLAN. 
 
A firewall change request needs to be submitted for each set up to have the VLAN 136 IP address speak with the VLAN 862 IP address for the associated pin pad to computer set up.
 
NOTE:  This means, that you CANNOT move the PerfectMind workstation or PinPad to another cable / port without the assistance of the PerfectMind team and networking to reconfigure the switch port and PerfectMind Station setup.  If this happens, they will not be able to process payments.
 
Once the workstation is plugged in with the proper VLAN, you must configure it for a Static IP address, which is assigned to that particular location.  The PerfectMind Administrators hold the spreadsheet containing the addresses for both the computers and the pin pads.
 
In order to test the configuration, the staff at the site will need to initialize the pinpad and process a transaction.
 
New pin pads or pin pad replacements will need to be programmed with the static IP address assigned.  This can typically be done by the Moneris Technician when replaced but in the event that it is missed or incorrectly programmed it can be done by DI & IT on site.  Consult with the System Administrators to obtain the correct IP address for the station pin pad.
 
The System Administrators for PerfectMind will need to be involved when you are working on a machine that will handle payments.

NOTE: The WYSE terminal has an IP address that displays the physical IP of the device. The Windows virtual desktop has its own IP address which is assigned by Citrix. If users are NOT utilizing the BAS Shared Desktops, the Windows IP address is found the same way before using BGinfo.    BGInfo is not present in the Hosted Shared (BAS) Desktops, as they are all connected to sessions on the same servers and would therefore have the same IP.  For these instances, you would need to use Director to establish a remote session.

,Privileged Access (Installer) for Windows 10,"We are reviewing the �Installer permissions� as users move to the Windows 10 operating system � no users will have these permissions by default (ie:  they are not carried over from their W7 permissions).   Please note that we are calling it �Privileged Access�, and not Installer rights, as the granting of this role gives much more computer and network access than simply allowing users to install software.  To attempt   to curb the proliferation of malware and viruses, only users who require this access to perform their day to day job will be granted these permissions.    
 
 Our procedure for handling these requests is below:

�       If you receive a request to obtain installer rights (new request, or �I had it before in Windows 7�), please advise the users of our model for privileged access.  Here is some wording:

o   �For an increased security posture, we have moved to a least privileged model.  This allows IT to ensure that only approved and tested software is permitted to be installed on the COB hardware, and also reduces the likelihood of malicious software compromising and proliferating throughout the City of Brampton IT systems.  With the recent events of Municipal compromises and data breaches, as well as the Audit, Security and Risk recommendations, we have implemented this model.  The majority of software is distributed to COB computers via the Software Center.  If you require additional software to be installed, updates to software, or device installation, a Service Desk ticket can be submitted, and the Customer Care team will assist.�

�       Let the user know that if they feel that they do require these rights for their job, that they will need to fill out and submit the request form.

�       When you receive back the form, please attach to the Service Request and pass it onto the End User Computing team.

�       If the user is a Technical IT staff member, EUC will grant the rights.

�       If the user is not a Technical IT staff member, EUC will perform an analysis of why they are requesting it, alternatives, etc, and pass onto the Security group if required.

,Adobe Creative Cloud process,"Nuance Power PDF is still our main PDF application, and if users feel this doesn�t provide the functionality they desire, they still need to submit a ticket requesting Adobe Acrobat Professional, at which point a quote will be given to them.  This software is quite expensive.
 
The installation process for the user is different than other applications deployed within the COB, as the installs themselves will come directly from Adobe, and only an Adobe self serve console will be deployed via SCCM.  I have attached the instructions that the users will be receiving.  Can you please review these instructions so that you are familiar with the process in the event that you receive support calls.
 
A highlight of the process is as follows:

�         User puts in a ticket requesting Adobe product(s)
�         Blair obtains a quote and provides to the User / Manager
�         User / Manager approves and Blair places the order
�         Blair sends the user the instructions for installation
�         Blair assigns the license to the user
�         User creates an AdobeID and accepts the license (done automatically when they log in through the link)
�         User install the Self Service Portal from SCCM
�         User installs the Adobe products they require from the Adobe Creative Cloud Self Service Portal
�         User will call the Service Desk if there are any issues

       The products included with each license are:

Acrobat  
After Effects  
Audition  
Bridge  
Dreamweaver  
Edge  
Fireworks  
Flash  
Illustrator  
InCopy  
InDesign
